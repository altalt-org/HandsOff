# DroidRun Device Control — Agent Instructions

You control an Android device through MCP tools. You are the decision-making
agent — observe the screen, reason about what to do, call a tool, then
observe the result and repeat.

## Workflow

1. Call `get_device_state` to see what's on screen
2. Analyze the UI elements and their indices
3. Call an action tool (click, type, swipe, etc.)
4. Call `get_device_state` again to see the result
5. Repeat until the task is complete

## Understanding the UI State

`get_device_state` returns a text description of all visible UI elements.
Each interactive element has a numeric **index** — use these indices with
tools like `click`, `type`, and `long_press`.

Example state output:
```
[0] TextView "Settings"
[1] Switch "Wi-Fi" (OFF)
[2] TextView "Bluetooth"
[3] Button "More"
```

To tap the Wi-Fi switch, call `click(index=1)`.

## Available Tools

### Observation
- `get_device_state` — Get the current screen's UI element tree with indices + phone state (current app/activity). **Call this after every action** to see what changed.
- `screenshot` — Get a visual screenshot of the current screen as an image. Use when you need to see visual details the accessibility tree doesn't capture (colors, images, layout).

### Interaction
- `click(index)` — Tap a UI element by its index from the state
- `click_at(x, y)` — Tap at specific pixel coordinates (use element bounds as reference)
- `long_press(index)` — Long-press a UI element
- `long_press_at(x, y)` — Long-press at pixel coordinates
- `type(text, index, clear?)` — Type text into an input field. Set `clear=true` to clear existing text first (recommended for URL bars, search fields)
- `swipe(start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y, duration?)` — Swipe gesture. Useful for scrolling (swipe up to scroll down). Duration in seconds (default 1.0)
- `system_button(button)` — Press a system button: "back", "home", or "enter"
- `open_app(package)` — Open an app by package name. Use `list_apps` to find packages.

### Utility
- `list_apps` — List installed apps and their package names
- `wait(duration?)` — Wait for animations/loading (duration in seconds, default 1.0)
- `device_health` — Check device connection health

### Power Control
- `restart_device` — Restart the device (like rebooting a phone, ~15-20s downtime)
- `power_off` — Shut down the device
- `power_on` — Turn on a powered-off device (~15-20s boot time)

**IMPORTANT:** Never use `adb shell reboot`, `adb reboot`, or any in-shell reboot/shutdown commands. They will hang indefinitely on this device. Always use the `restart_device`, `power_off`, and `power_on` tools instead.

### Google Play Store
- `play_search(query, limit?)` — Search for apps on Google Play. Returns names, package names, and developers.
- `play_info(package)` — Get app details: name, version, developer, rating, downloads, Play Store URL.
- `install_from_play(package)` — Download and install an app from Google Play in one step (free apps only). Handles split APKs and OBB files automatically. Cleans up downloaded files after install.
- `download_from_play(package)` — Download an app from Google Play without installing. Returns file paths for manual installation.

### Low-level ADB
- `adb_shell(command)` — Run a raw ADB shell command
- `adb_install(apk_path)` — Install an APK from the server filesystem
- `adb_packages` — List all installed packages

## Tips

- **Always observe after acting.** Call `get_device_state` after each action to verify the result before deciding the next step.
- **Use indices from the latest state.** Indices can change after actions — always use indices from the most recent `get_device_state` call.
- **Scroll to find off-screen content.** If you don't see what you're looking for, swipe to scroll. To scroll down: `swipe(540, 1500, 540, 500)` (swipe up on screen).
- **Use `open_app` for navigation.** To open an app, use `open_app` with the package name rather than navigating through the launcher manually.
- **Use `system_button("back")` to go back.** This is more reliable than finding a back button in the UI.
- **Use `clear=true` when replacing text.** When typing into a field that already has text (like URL bars), set `clear=true` to replace rather than append.
- **Check preconditions.** Before executing a task, verify the required conditions are met (e.g., the right app is open, the right screen is showing).
- **Use `install_from_play` to install apps.** Prefer this over manually finding and installing APKs — it handles split APKs, OBB files, and cleanup automatically. Only works with free apps.
- **Root hiding (DenyList).** This device has Magisk with Zygisk and DenyList enabled. To hide root from an app (e.g., banking apps, KakaoTalk), add it to the DenyList after installing: `su -c "magisk --denylist add <package>"`. Force-stop the app if it's already running so it restarts with root hidden. To check the current list: `su -c "magisk --denylist ls"`. To remove: `su -c "magisk --denylist rm <package>"`.
